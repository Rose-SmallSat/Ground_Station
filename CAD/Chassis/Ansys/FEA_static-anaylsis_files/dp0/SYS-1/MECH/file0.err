 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.391   TIME= 06:01:55
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.047   TIME= 06:01:55
 Material number 235 (used by element 180136) should normally have at    
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.047   TIME= 06:01:55
 No constraints have been defined using the D command.                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       5.672   TIME= 06:01:56
 Maximum contact stiffness 3.771970595E+16 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      10.797   TIME= 06:02:00
 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 out-of-core memory mode.  This memory mode may provide significantly    
 worse performance compared to the in-core memory mode, depending on     
 the amount of available system memory and I/O speed.  Please monitor    
 the solver performance to ensure that the large amount of I/O to the    
 solver files does not create a bottleneck for performance.              

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =      14.000   TIME= 06:02:04
 A large negative pivot value ( -5.9279036E-03 ) has been encountered in 
 the global assembled matrix at the UY degree of freedom of node 14180.  
  This may be caused by a bad temperature-dependent material property    
 used in the model.
