/COM,ANSYS RELEASE 2023 R1           BUILD 23.1      UP20221128       10:20:01

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.375   TIME= 10:20:02
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.938   TIME= 10:20:02
 Material number 235 (used by element 180136) should normally have at    
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.938   TIME= 10:20:02
 No constraints have been defined using the D command.                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      16.016   TIME= 10:20:13
 There is at least 1 small equation solver pivot term (e.g., at the UY   
 degree of freedom of node 88082) which may indicate a numerically       
 unstable model.  Please check your results carefully.                   

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =      16.312   TIME= 10:20:13
 The value of UY at node 24648 is 4202960.51.  It is greater than the    
 current limit of 1000000 (which can be reset on the NCNV command).      
 This generally indicates rigid body motion as a result of an            
 unconstrained model.  Verify that your model is properly constrained.   

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =      16.312   TIME= 10:20:13
 *** MESSAGE CONTINUATION ---- DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION ***                
 If one or more parts of the model are held together only by contact     
 verify that the contact surfaces are closed.  Also make sure that       
 there are constraints (or friction) in the sliding direction even if    
 no load is applied in that direction.  You can use the CNCHECK command  
 to check the initial contact status in the SOLUTION module.
