 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.266   TIME= 18:14:57
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.719   TIME= 18:14:57
 Material number 235 (used by element 180136) should normally have at    
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.719   TIME= 18:14:57
 No constraints have been defined using the D command.                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       6.500   TIME= 18:14:59
 Maximum contact stiffness 3.771970595E+16 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      12.422   TIME= 18:15:04
 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 out-of-core memory mode.  This memory mode may provide significantly    
 worse performance compared to the in-core memory mode, depending on     
 the amount of available system memory and I/O speed.  Please monitor    
 the solver performance to ensure that the large amount of I/O to the    
 solver files does not create a bottleneck for performance.              

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =      15.812   TIME= 18:15:08
 There is at least 1 small equation solver pivot term (e.g., at the UX   
 degree of freedom of node 88190).  Please check for an insufficiently   
 constrained model.
